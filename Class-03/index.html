                   <h3>The Best Way to Lace Oxfords</h3>
                   <p>This works for all kinds of oxfords, not matter how many eyelets they have. Most oxfords have 5 rows of eyelets, and that’s what we use here.</p>
                    <ul class="check-icon">
                        <li>Insert both ends of the lace in the bottom holes /eyelets of the shoe, so you have a line that is horizontal and on top of the leather.</li>
                        <li>Pull both ends so they are even and have the same length if you have an even number of eyelets such as 4,6… For uneven eyelets, 5, 7 etc. the lace on the outside of the shoe should be about 2? – 5 cm longer.</li>
                        <li>Take the lace on the outside of the shoe, and insert it from the bottom in the second hole on the same side, and back into the second hole on the opposite side from the top.</li>
                        <li>Now, take the lace on the inside of the shoe and insert it from the bottom in the third hole on the same side, and back into the third hole on the opposite side from the top.</li>
                        <li>Continue in the same fashion. With an even number of eyelets, you will reach the top eyelets from the bottom on each side and it tools great. With uneven holes, you have to make a cross underneath with one end from the bottom. For that reason, one shoelace has to be longer than the other one.</li>
                        <li>Pull on both ends to tighten the lacing and tie your shoelace. Traditionally</li>
